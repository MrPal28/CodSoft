2. **Setup**: 
   - The game will generate a random number between 1 and 100.
   - The player will be given a maximum of 5 attempts to guess the number correctly.

3. **Gameplay**:
   - The player will be prompted to enter their guess for the generated number.
   - After each guess, the game will provide feedback to the player on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
   - If the guess is correct, the game will congratulate the player, display the number of attempts taken, and calculate the player's score based on the number of attempts.
   - If the guess is incorrect, the game will inform the player whether the guess was too high or too low, and the player will be allowed to make another guess.
   - The game will continue until the player guesses the number correctly or exhausts all attempts.

4. **Scoring**:
   - The player's score will be calculated based on the number of attempts taken to guess the number.
   - The score will be calculated as follows: \( \text{Score} = 100 - (\text{attempts} \times 10) \)
   - The maximum score per round is 100, and the minimum score is 0.

5. **Play Again**:
   - After each round, the player will be asked if they want to play again.
   - If the player chooses to play again, a new random number will be generated, and the game will restart.
   - If the player chooses not to play again, the game will end, and the final score will be displayed.

6. **Winning**:
   - The player wins the game by correctly guessing the randomly generated number within the maximum number of attempts.

7. **Losing**:
   - The player loses the game if they exhaust all attempts without guessing the number correctly.
   - In this case, the game will reveal the correct number to the player.

These rules outline the objectives, setup, gameplay, scoring, play again option, and conditions for winning and losing in the number guessing game.
